# Redirect & Uptime Monitoring Agent Architecture

## Overview
The Monitoring Agent is responsible for tracking website redirects, uptime, and error events, and pushing alerts to Task Master for visibility and action.

## Components

### 1. Redirect Monitoring
- **Purpose:**
  - Track HTTP redirect responses for monitored URLs.
  - Detect redirect chains and identify infinite loops.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Periodically request URLs and follow redirects.
  - Log each redirect hop and chain length.
  - Flag chains exceeding a threshold or looping back to the same URL.

### 2. Uptime & Error Monitoring
- **Purpose:**
  - Monitor server uptime and detect HTTP 4xx/5xx errors.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Periodically ping endpoints and record response codes and times.
  - Log downtime events and persistent error responses.
  - Differentiate between transient and persistent issues.

### 3. Alert Aggregator
- **Purpose:**
  - Aggregate logs and events from Redirect and Uptime/Error Monitoring.
  - Format and prioritize alerts for Task Master.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Collect and deduplicate alerts.
  - Assign severity levels (e.g., critical, warning, info).
  - Prepare alert payloads with context (URL, error type, timestamps).

### 4. Task Master Integration
- **Purpose:**
  - Push alerts to Task Master for ticketing and tracking.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Authenticate and connect to Task Master API.
  - Send alert payloads as new issues or updates.
  - Log responses and handle API errors.

## Interactions
- Redirect and Uptime/Error Monitoring run on a schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes).
- Both components log events to the Alert Aggregator.
- The Alert Aggregator batches and formats alerts, then sends them to Task Master Integration.
- Task Master Integration creates or updates tickets/issues in Task Master.

## Extensibility
- Additional monitoring (e.g., SSL expiry, DNS changes) can be added as new components.
- Alerting can be extended to other systems (e.g., Slack, email) as needed.
